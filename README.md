## My Tidy Tuesday Visualizations!

This repository contains all of my data visualizations for the [Tidy
Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data sets
released. Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project that anyone can
contribute to, where the goal is to create interesting and insightful
data visualizations. It's organized by the R4DS learning community. You
can join their slack by visiting the Tidy Tuesday GitHub repo linked
above.
